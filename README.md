# SceneGraphDiffusion
 
This repository contains the scripts for image generation based on diffusion model. Scene graph is used to guide the image generation.
The scripts are extended based on the previous work on [scene-graph](https://github.com/google/sg2im), [DDPM](https://github.com/zoubohao/DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-) and [DDIM](https://github.com/ermongroup/ddim)
